# International Debt Analysis
Humans not only take debts to manage necessities, but countries also take debt to manage their economies. For instance, infrastructure spending is a significant expense necessary for a country's citizens to lead comfortable lives. The World Bank is one of the primary organizations that provide debt to countries.

In this project, we analyzed international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. Through this analysis, we answered the following key questions:

What is the number of distinct countries present in the database?
Which country has the highest amount of debt?
Which country has the lowest amount of repayments?
Data Description
The dataset includes various columns that capture information about:

Country Name
Country Code
Debt Category
Debt Amount (in USD)
Repayment Amount
